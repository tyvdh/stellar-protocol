# Summary
Turing Signing Servers allow for secure, decentralized transaction creation and signing through programmable contracts.

# Motivation
There are many instances where both decentralized transaction creation and execution is necessary and preferred in service or business logic. This is something Ethereum has natively while Stellar only has transaction execution baked into the protocol. While turing complete programming isn't something Stellar will or should ever have, the ability to create transactions in a trust minimized, decentralized way will greatly expand the usefulness and appeal of Stellar for the greater ecosystem.

# Abstract
In short there are two capabilities being added in this SEP to allow for decentralized transaction creation. Multisig signing keys which sign transactions generated by smart contract functions.

# Specification

## Content Type

All endpoints accept `Content-Type: application/json` with the exception of `POST /contract` and `UPDATE /contract/<hash>` which accepts `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.

All endpoints respond with `Content-Type: application/json` with the exception of `GET /contract/<hash>/run/collate` and `PUT /contract/<hash>` which respond with `Content-Type: text/plain`.

## Errors

If an error occurs when calling any endpoint, an appropriate HTTP status code
will be returned along with an error message.

### Status Code

Common HTTP status codes may be returned for a server. In particular the following are expected:

Status Code | Name | Reason
-----|------|------------
`400` | Bad Request | The request is invalid in anyway.
`404` | Not Found | The path is not recognized by the server, or the address does not have a contract.

### Response

#### Fields

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`message` | string | A description of the error.

#### Example

```json
{
  "message": "..."
}
```

### `POST /contract`

This endpoint uploads a smart contract.

#### Request

##### Fields

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`file` | file | The contract function file the contract creator is uploading to the turing server.
`contract` | string | Stellar public key address used for signing updates.
`turrets` | string | base64 encoded comma-separated list of urls where this contract will be hosted.
`fields` | array\<\{name: string, type: string\|object\|array, description: string, rule: string\}\> | Array of objects detailing the expected incoming request parameters. `name` is the key for the outgoing request. `type` is the key value type, e.g. `"string"` or `"number"`. `description` is the human readable display explanation for the intention behind the given field. `rule` is a service provider explanation for any restrictions which could cause the request to be rejected. Intended to help build regex flows or help explain incoming errors from a given contract.

##### Example

```json5
// TODO: include example for both array and object types

{
  "file": {
    ...
    "path": "/path/to/contract.js",
    ...
  },

    },
    {
      "name": "amount",
      "type": "string",

`signer` | string | The signing account for this contract on this turing server. This is what you'll add to contract or user accounts for multisig protection.
`fee` | string | The XLM fee required by this turing server to sign for contracts.

```json
{
  "hash": "06953...67bc2",
